            I was pleasantly surprised by the variety of embroidery offered by
            Vyshyvanka Vibes. They have models for every taste - from classic to
            modern. I bought an embroidered dress to celebrate a special
            occasion and received impeccable service and refinement in every
            detail.

            Vyshyvanka Vibes is a real find for everyone who appreciates
            Ukrainian culture. Their embroidery reflects the spirit and
            traditions of our people. I not only buy embroidered shirts for
            myself, but also give them to my friends abroad as a symbol of our
            beauty and national pride.

            I absolutely adore Vyshyvanka Vibes. The store has a huge assortment
            of clothes, you can choose for every day and for holidays. I have
            already bought two products. The quality is top notch! In addition,
            the store has very pleasant service. I recomend this shop to
            everyone.

            I'm very glad I found this store. I urgently needed to find our
            traditional clothes, but it turned out to be not so easy. There are
            very few beautiful embroidered shirts for men. Vyshyvanka Vibes has
            a large assortment and the quality is very pleasing. Finally i found
            great shop with traditional clothes.
